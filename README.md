# Performance Testing with Apache JMeter

This repository contains my work on performance testing using Apache JMeter. The project demonstrates how to create and execute performance tests, analyze results, and generate insightful reports.

## Features

- **Test Plan Setup:** Includes detailed test plans for performance testing.
- **Report Generation:** Automated reporting of performance metrics such as response times, throughput, and error rates.
- **Scalability Testing:** Analysis of system performance under various load conditions.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Apache JMeter:** Used for creating and running the performance tests.
- **GitHub:** For version control and collaboration.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:

1. **Measure Application Performance:** To understand the behavior of the application under various load scenarios.
2. **Identify Bottlenecks:** To pinpoint performance issues that need to be addressed.
3. **Optimize System Performance:** To ensure the application can handle expected traffic efficiently.

## Repository Structure

- `TestPlans/` - Contains JMeter test plan files (`.jmx`).
- `Reports/` - Stores generated performance test reports, including graphs and tables.
- `README.md` - This documentation file.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chaity-paul/performance-testing-jmeter.git
   ```

2. **Set Up JMeter:**
   Download and install [Apache JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/).

3. **Run Test Plans:**
   - Open the `.jmx` files in JMeter.
   - Configure test parameters as needed.
   - Execute the test plans to collect performance data.

4. **Generate Reports:**
   - Navigate to the `Reports/` directory to view the generated reports.

## Prerequisites

- Apache JMeter (version X.X or later)
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
